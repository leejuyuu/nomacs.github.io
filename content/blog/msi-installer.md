Since a lot of you were asking for a blind installer and/or an msi installer.
We have now created an msi installer with nomacs 3.6 beta.
We would be happy if you could test this installer and leave feedback here,
so that switching to msi in the next version works smooth.
thanks,
â€” the nomacs team
