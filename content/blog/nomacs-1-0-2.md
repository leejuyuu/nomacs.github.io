about 40 years <sub>and 2 days</sub> after Martin Cooper ([@MartyMobile](https://twitter.com/MartyMobile))
did the first mobile telephone call,
the first bugfix-only nomacs is released.
the bugfixes include:

- Support for DNG format
- Zoom/Pan is faster for Mac OS
- EXIF data can be read for UTF-8 files (Windows only)
- Open With starts custom executables again
- Drag&Drop works directly after installing (no administrator privilegs)
- dpi is now saved when changing it in the resize dialog
- resize dialog does not crash for 40k x 30k images
- translations updated & serbian translation added

## NOTE

for the automatic update routine will download the wrong version for Windows XP
(this is already fixed in the 1.0.2 version – so it is the last time you need to manually install nomacs : )
