<img alt="bug-free" src="bug-free.jpg" width="100%">

we have improved and extended the pretty stable nomacs 1.0.2 version.
If we are not as bug free as we claim to be, please send us reports.
New features include:

- Customizable Shortcuts
- Folder Preview – Color Encoded Folder Scrollbar
- New Image Formats – WebP, PSD, TGA, (JPEG2000 not WinXP)
- Add New Image Formats
- Support Additional Mouse Keys
- Ignore Raw Images if JPG is Present
- New Translations – Italian, Slovene, Czech, Serbian, Portuguese (thanks to all translators)

and of course we fixed all bugs that we were able to and seemed to be important.
