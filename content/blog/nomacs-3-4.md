may we introduce nomacs 3.4 – It’s all fresh and organic.
This version introduces a new batch processing UI.
We have added profiles – so you can save common batch configurations (and run them from the command line).

Info for Windows users: we recommend to uninstall any prior version of nomacs and then install nomacs 3.4.

- Batch UI reworked
- Batch Profiles added
- Cropping to metadata
- RGB to Gray improved
- Crash on delete fixed
- Slow thumbnail rendering fixed
- Start-up time improved
- RAW/PSD orientation fixed
