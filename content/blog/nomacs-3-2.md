nomacs 3.2 is out.
We were working mainly on the plugin framework which is now integrated in the windows installer and fully supported on Linux.
In addition to this, the preferences are now integrated into nomacs. Here is an overview of the most important changes:

- Plugin framework redesigned
- New preferences
- Undo & History dock added
- Statusbar improved (e.g. zoom level)
- All Icons are SVG (UHD monitors)
- Compression added to Batch
- Image transitions extended (swipe)
- Logging added
- Recent files cleaned
