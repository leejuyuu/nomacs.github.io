sunny day in Vienna…

This is perfectly not related to the the release of nomacs 1.6.

New features are:

- Grid View for Thumbnails
- Image Mosaicing Tool
- Gif Player (Pause Animated Images and View Frame by Frame)
- WebP on all platforms
- Customizable Mouse Wheel
- French Translation

… and we fixed all bugs reported (except for 5 bugs).
