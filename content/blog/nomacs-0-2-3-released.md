as small pre-christmas present we’ve just released a new version of nomacs.
we want to thank petr vanek for improving our project infrastructure and shipping nomacs to other operating systems
(be surprised : )

new features include:

- hide player and nasty labels (e.g. loading) on fullscreen (thanks to asen)
- display information for slideshows
- format metadata
- bugfix in network
- bugfix in save jpg dialog (now the compression rate can be modified again : )

a very merry christmas and a happy new year (as lennon sang)

— the nomacs team
