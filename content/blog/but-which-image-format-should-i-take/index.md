Since we see a lot of people choosing the wrong image formats on a daily basis, we have created a short cheat sheet for you.
Though JPEG is probably the easiest way to archive your pictures,
there are several incentives to choose another image format depending on the image content or purpose.
(You can also [download](image-formats.pdf) the cheat sheet)

  <img alt="Image formats for illustrations" src="illustration.png" width="100%"/>
