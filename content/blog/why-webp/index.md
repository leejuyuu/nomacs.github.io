according to a feature request from dadatamada we took a closer look to the webP format.
the screenshot shows a nightly build of nomacs with webP load/save functionality.
if an image needs to be compressed, webP shows a far better image quality while decreasing the file size.
note that the jpg compressed image (right) has 16.6 KB while the webP image only needs 6.8 KB.
another advantage is the fact that webP features a full (8bit) alpha channel and supports lossless compressionâ€¦
