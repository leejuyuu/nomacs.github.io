so the news are always the same on this page – again we have updated nomacs.
this version contains a few new features:

- Auto Adjustment/Auto Normalization/Invert Image functions added
- Flip (Horizontally/Vertically) functions added
- Recursive Folder Scan
- Fast(er) RAW loading with embedded thumbnail extraction
- save for web dialog – that allows for easy resizing and saving
- the window position is remembered even if the window was snapped previously
- a Run button is added to the new Open With dialog – hence it is similar to the old one

we hope you enjoy this version — even more — than the old nomacs versions
— the nomacs team
