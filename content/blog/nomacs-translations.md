we are about to release nomacs 0.2.5 (in the next few days).
in addition to several bugfixes, performance improvements and features, nomacs will be shipped with translations.
currently english, german and russian (thanks to dadatamada) are supported.
if you want the new viewer to talk with you in your language you could translate the current UI at <https://translate.nomacs.org>.
