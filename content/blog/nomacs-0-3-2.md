today we have released version 0.3.2 as you can see in the version number,
this is just a minor update which fixes some bugs.
additionally we were able to speed up the file indexing on windows
(folders with more than 30 000 files are now indexed in 200 ms compared to 2.5 sec).
two new features include a percent option in the resize dialog
(for those who are lazy in mental arithmetics) and a chinese translation.
