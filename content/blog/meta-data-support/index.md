We have added a panel which allows you to view all meta data which is present in an image.
In addition to typical exif/XMP meta data, the file info like owner/group of an image and its thumbnail are displayed in this panel.

Tim Jerman added a support for zip archives (besides some awesome plugins) within the
[Google Summer of Code 2014](https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2014).
This feature will allow you to browse images in zip archives without extracting them first.
That’s nice so far… the really cool thing is that you can additionally browse through images in Microsoft Office Documents such as Word, PowerPoint.
