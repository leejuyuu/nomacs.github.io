<img alt="a preview of the transparent view of nomacs" src="nomacs-transparent-view.png" width="100%">

we’ve implemented a frameless view for nomacs (months ago).
it is not stable yet (if you zoom in too much it, nomacs will crash :).
however, if you want to give it a try: just hit F10.
of course we appreciate any feedback (as usual)
