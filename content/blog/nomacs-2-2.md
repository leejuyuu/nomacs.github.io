you know we like numbers… so we release nomacs 2.2 on 11.11.
This version fixes a few issues you reported and adds cool features such as reading images from zip
(docx, xlsx, pptx) archives, or a full metadata panel.
The full changelog is:

- Reading images from ZIP (+ Office Documents e.g. docx, xlsx, pptx)
- Metadata panel (displays all metadata of an image)
- Thumbnail panel layout (Vertical or Undock)
- Notes (you can now take and display notes which are written to the image metadata)
- Private mode which does not save any settings including recent files
- Option which disables check for updates
- Option which disables logging of recent files/folders
- Additional RAW files added (including Pentax \[PEF\], Samsung \[SRW\], Hasselblad \[3FR\] and Sigma \[X3F\])
- JPG2000 read/write fixed for large files (windows with setup only)
- Resize dialog fixes
- File order fixed for Linux/Unix
- Segfault fixed if ‘fast thumbnail preview’ is checked
- Saving images without extension (linux only) fixed
