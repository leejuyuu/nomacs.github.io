In addition to these changes, we worked on these features:

- Full SVG support
- Quick Launch added
- [Tiny planet](/blog/tiny-planet/) option added
- [Batch processing](/blog/batch-processing/) improved
- Signed executable – Windows only
- Libraries updated – Qt 5.5, OpenCV 3
- [Command line arguments](/blog/command-line-options) added
- Zoom control improved
- nomacs learned two new languages – Bulgarian and Ukrainian
- new plugin: Page Extraction – detects and/or crops document pages

Open Source software, we moved our download pages away from SourceForge.
These are the new locations:

- Installer <http://download.nomacs.org>
- Portable <http://download.nomacs.org/portable>
- Tarball <https://github.com/nomacs/nomacs/releases/>
