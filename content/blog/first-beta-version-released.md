nomacs 0.2.0 is out

new features include:

- start up time improved
- locate your geo referenced images on google maps
- change the image resolution/image size
- metadata: added path, file size, resolution
- you can add a temp path – all screenshots or pasted images are stored there
- sync: panning without position matching (for similar images having a different resolution)
- set maximal zoom level for the interpolation (you can even turn off interpolation)
- direct link to bug report/feature request added in the help menu

… and we fixed a lot of bugs

since the project is beta now, you can even recommend it to your grandma : )
