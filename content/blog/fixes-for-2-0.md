first of all we want to thank those users who provided feedback for the shiny new 2.0 version of nomacs.
at the same time, the feedback kept us busy with fixing known issues.
the 2.0.2 release fixes particularly these issues:

- portable version always keeps settings (settings are not written to the registry anymore)
- plugin download for nomacs portable
- AppData is not written to home directory (sorry for that, you can delete this folder without any side effects)
- layout fixes in recent folders/files
- translation updates fixed
- thumbnail saving fixed

â€“ the nomacs team
