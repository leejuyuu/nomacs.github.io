since there were ~~(hardly any)~~ no bugs in the last release we focused on new features and skipped again at least one bug fix release.
the highly praised features include:

- Multi Page TIFF support – with export & convert to multiple files option
- Explorer Panel – for navigation
- Crop Toolbar – additional options for cropping
- Sort Images – by date modified/created
- …and some small features requested by you
