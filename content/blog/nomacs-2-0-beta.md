since we have changed a lot of code in the loading and saving routines,
we decided to release a beta version prior to the first 2.0 release.
if you find any bugs, please let us know.
new features of this beta are:

- Threaded file loading/saving
- UPnP support that allows for detecting nomacs in WLAN networks
- Option for syncing all actions
- Auto file updating (without locks)
- Full exif support on linux (fixes issue #192)
- White list to automatically connect with your computers
- Gamma correction on down sampling (fixes #322)
- New (improved) cacher
- Improvements in the Thumbnail Preview

you can download and test the beta here.
