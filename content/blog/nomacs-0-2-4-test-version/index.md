we have added an open with feature (#74) – currently it’s just implemented for windows.
we would appreciate,
if somebody could test weather the ‘Open With’ dialog automatically detects Photoshop CS4 or older versions,
Picasa2 and IrfanView < 4.3.

The dialog should look somehow like that screenshot if it works (and the software is installed on your system)

Here is the test version: windows installer or .zip package

thanks!
