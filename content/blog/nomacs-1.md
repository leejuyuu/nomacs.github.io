after one and a half year of development we now release the first (stable) nomacs 1.
as usual, the windows binaries are already released this time either 32-bit or 64-bit
(for those who view really huge images).
Linux, Mac and OS/2 will follow soon.

new features include:

- auto update
- image manipulation tools
- beautiful print preview
- find & filter files
- animated gifs (in the 21st century)
- customizable GUI (colorize icons etc.)
- advanced preferences dialog
- window transparency features (frameless & locking = watermark for screenvideos)
- set as wallpaper (windows)
- anti aliasing (smooth image rendering)
- improved de-mosaicing for RAW images
- batch compute thumbnails
- new translations: Spanish, Polish, Slovak and Azerbaijani (thanks to all translators)
