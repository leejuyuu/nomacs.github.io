today the official 0.3.0 nomacs was released.
For now its just windows, ubuntu will be released tomorrow and all versions for other OS need a bit more time.

new features include:

- Open with dialog
- Image cropping
- Resize image
- Pseudo Color function

- Translations
- Basic support for stereo images (\*.mpo, \*.jps, \*.pns)
- …and we polished our GUI

In addition we did some under the hood improvements
