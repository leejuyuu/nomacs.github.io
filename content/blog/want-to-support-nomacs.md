we would need your help for increasing the support of nomacs on different OS:

- OSX Build: in addition to Petr’s MacPort packages we would love to distribute dmgs of nomacs.
- Linux Plugins: we are seeking for someone who can help us with the packaging of plugins for Linux.

If you have experience in any of these fields and want to support us, you can leave a reply to this post or write us an e-mail (<developers@nomacs.org>).
– the nomacs team
