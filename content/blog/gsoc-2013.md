the [Computational Science and Enigneering at Vienna UT](https://www.iue.tuwien.ac.at/cse/index.php/gsoc/2013.html)
(including nomacs) has been accepted for [Google Summer of Code 2013](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013).
So if you are interested in improving nomacs, this is the only chance to earn money at the same time.
If you want to apply for the nomacs project @ GSoC2013 you should subscribe to our mailing list (<soc2013@iue.tuwien.ac.at>).

Do you have any questions concerning the

the [puzzle](https://web.archive.org/web/20210617214230/http://nomacs.org/google-summer-of-code-2013/)?
Please do not hesitate to contact us via this mailing list (or IRC #TU\_CSE\_SoC @ irc.freenode.net).
