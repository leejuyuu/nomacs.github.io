the new 2.4.0 release is a milestone in our development.
First, it will be the last feature release which mainly supports Qt 4 (again the numbers align perfectly: 2.4).
Second, it is probably the hugest feature release ever.
The most important features include tabs, an all-in-wonder batch processing, and an improved thumbnail preview.
Good news for all Windows XP and Vista users (who should definitely update their system : ),
we compiled [nomacs](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nomacs/files/nomacs-2.4.0/nomacs-setup-2.4.0-WinXP-x86.exe/download)
a last time for these systems.
Here is the full changelog:

- Batch processing (you can try it by clicking Tools > Batch Processing)
- Image tabs (open multiple images within different tabs)
- Thumbnail preview improved (copy/paste delete/rename is now supported)
- Zoom panel improved (you can now chose a specific zoom level)
- Olympus RAW added
- Convert to grayscale added (thanks to [shreelock](https://github.com/shreelock))
- Faster directory loading (especially if you have many images in a folder)
- Gesture improvements
- Saving of images from archives (e.g. zip, docx) is now supported
- File sorting improved (Unix-based systems only)
- Stability improvements
