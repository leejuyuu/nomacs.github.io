nomacs can turn your photo spheres into Tiny Planets.
Therefore, you first need to capture a photo sphere.
Here is how you do this in your camera app on Android:

<img src="photo-sphere.png" alt="photo-sphere" width="100%"/>

In nomacs you can choose Edit > Tiny Planet to turn your favorite photo sphere into a tiny planet.
<img src="img-2015-12-17-16.50.43.png" alt="edit-tiny-planet" width="100%"/>

In the Tiny Planet dialog, you can adjust the planetâ€™s size and orientation. And here is how the result looks:
<img src="kalenberg-new-ps.jpg" alt="kalenberg-new-ps" width="100%"/>
